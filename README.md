# hddLedDimming  

LED dimming with PWM  
LED高位调光

-------
## Software  

Base code was generated by STM32cubeMX.  
You can find out all the function of MCU pin by open hddLedDimming.ioc with STM32cubeMX.  
All codes which I had writen was in the file Src/main.c
The interface USART1 was set to output debug message every second.  
e.g.
```text
avg adc val:545, pwm cmp:70/239, duty cycle:29% \n
``` 

----------
## Hardware

PWM generated by STM32F030F4P6 timer, the duty cycle decide by AD value.   
All hardware design will be put in pcb folder.
